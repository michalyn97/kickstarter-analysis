# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to analyze how successful the plays were based upon their launch date.---
Where they more successful in the winter, spring, summer or fall.---
Let's take a look.

## Analysis and Challenges
It appears that there was a cyclical trend with the success of the plays based upon the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date chart.

Some of the challenges was incorporating the failed projects in the chart to illustrate how the failed plays were typically during the winter/spring months.---
The most successful projects were in the summer months where there was a rise in donations.   Specifically in July.---
The rise appeared to go back down as the fall and winter months hit.---

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some of the challenges I faced is filtering the data properly, finally understanding how to add the years an being overwhelmed with so much data and how to properly convey
a concise story to "Louise".   
I did contact the Ask BCS Learning Assistant which was a Godsend but I wanted to work on my own and not keep asking questions and setting up Zoom meetings to share my screen.


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The two conclusions are:
*People pledged a lot more money in the summer months than the winter/spring months.---
*The most unsuccessful month for the year was May.---

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
*There were a lot more successful plays than failed.---

- What are some limitations of this dataset?---
The chart data may have been more accurate if I had included the country as there may have been a correlation.---

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A pie graph may have been helpful as you can get a better visualization of failed, successful and canceled projects.
